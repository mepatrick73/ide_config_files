Here is list of things of what an ide should and their bindings I need to implement:

Basic stuff:
		-leader key: space

	harpoon/
	pasting stuff:
		-pasting a new line without insert mode: Leader-o
		-pasting a new line above without insert mode Leader-O
		-Ctrl-V in insert mode should paste from the clipboard register

	tab/pane stuff:
		-switching tabs: c-shift-h left c-shift-l right
		-splittings panes: c-% vertical pane, c-" horizontal pane
		-moving focus between panes: c-h to the left, c-j bottom, c-k top, c-l right
		-close a tab should be done: with c-q
		-closing down a pane should be done with c-Q

	file explorer stuff:
		-Opening file explorer is done with Leader-n-e
		-Creating new file is ctrl-n
		-Creating new folder is Ctrl-shift-n
		-Deleting should be done with Ctrl-shit-d
		-Leader-f to allow me look up files
		-standard vim motions to move up and down
		-Ctrl-Q to leave the file tree
		TODO: figure out a good keybind for leaving the file explorer, in vim land these are buffers

	terminal stuff:
		-Openin the terminal windows should be ctrl-shift-j //this will be splitting the view in wt
		-resizing terminal alt-u and alt-d
		-changing focus alt-hjkl
		-a new terminal should be ctrl-shift-1
		-go the next terminal with ctrl-a
		-go previous terminal with ctrl-b
	

	harpoon stuff:

	easy keybinds:
		-rebinding :w to leader-w
		-rebinding H to start of the line and L to $

	cool keybinds: 

	plugins I want to use:
